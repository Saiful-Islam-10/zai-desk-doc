### What is the purpose of the user-customer-agent interaction in a support desk application??

The user-customer-agent interaction in a support desk application is designed to facilitate effective communication between users (customers with issues or queries) and support agents (staff responsible for resolving those issues). It allows users to submit support tickets, receive assistance, and track the progress of their inquiries.

### How can a user create a support ticket in the application?

To create a support ticket, a user needs to log into their account, navigate to the "Support" or "Help" section, and click on the "Create New Ticket" button. They should provide a title, description, and select a priority level for the issue. After submitting, the ticket will be assigned to a support agent for resolution.

### What is the purpose of assigning priorities to support tickets?

Assigning priorities helps support agents address critical issues first. Priorities can range from low to urgent, allowing agents to allocate resources efficiently and ensure that urgent matters are resolved promptly.

### How can users track the status of their support tickets?

Users can track the status of their support tickets by logging into their account and viewing the ticket list. Each ticket's status (open, in progress, closed) will be indicated, along with any updates or comments added by support agents.

### What role does a support agent play in the user-customer-agent interaction?

Support agents are responsible for resolving user issues. They review submitted tickets, gather necessary information, communicate with users to understand the problem, provide solutions or assistance, and update ticket status and comments throughout the process.

### How can a user communicate with a support agent regarding their ticket?

Users can communicate with support agents by leaving comments within the ticket's detail view. This allows for a seamless and documented exchange of information, enabling both parties to stay informed about the progress and resolution of the issue.

### How does the application ensure security and privacy during user-customer-agent interactions?

The application employs secure authentication mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users have access to support tickets and personal data. All interactions and communications are encrypted to protect sensitive information and maintain user privacy.

### What kind of notifications do users receive during the interaction?

Users receive notifications for various events, including when their support ticket is received, when a support agent comments on their ticket, and when their ticket's status changes (e.g., from open to closed). Notifications keep users informed about the progress of their inquiries.
